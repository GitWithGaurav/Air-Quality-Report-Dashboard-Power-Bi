Air Quality Report Dashboard 🌍

Overview
This project leverages Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing air quality data. The dashboard provides insights into air quality trends, pollutant levels, and regional comparisons, helping stakeholders monitor and improve environmental conditions.

Project Objectives
Analyze air quality trends across regions and time periods.
Identify key pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
Provide actionable insights to mitigate pollution and enhance public awareness.

Features
📊 Interactive Dashboard
Real-time visualization of Air Quality Index (AQI) trends.
Drill-through functionality to explore detailed pollutant data.
Heatmaps for regional air quality comparisons.

📈 Key Metrics
AQI Trends: Line charts for daily, monthly, and yearly trends.
Pollutant Contributions: Bar and pie charts showcasing levels of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3.
Regional Analysis: Compare pollution levels using dynamic maps.
🛠️ Filters and Slicers
Time Period: Filter by year, month, or custom date range.
Region/City: Select specific locations for focused analysis.
Pollutants: Analyze individual or combined pollutant levels.
Data Sources
📂 Primary Dataset
Source: [Example: OpenAQ API, National Air Quality Monitoring Program].
Attributes:
Date, City/Region
Pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3)
Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed
🧹 Preprocessing Steps
SQL: Extracted and cleaned raw data.
Python: Managed missing values, normalized AQI values, and handled outliers.
Tools and Techniques
🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI: Interactive visualizations and dashboard creation.
SQL: Data querying and preprocessing.
